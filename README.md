# Sales Data Warehouse - README

## Project Overview
This project sets up a **Sales Data Warehouse** designed to consolidate and analyze sales data. The data warehouse integrates data from various sources, helping to generate reports, perform analysis, and make informed business decisions.

## Structure of the SQL File
The SQL script in this repository includes:

- **Table Creation:** The script creates tables necessary for the data warehouse, including fact and dimension tables for sales transactions.
- **Data Insertion:** Example or placeholder data can be inserted into the tables.
- **Indexes & Constraints:** Indices and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) are set up to ensure data integrity and improve query performance.

## Key Tables
- **Sales Fact Table:** Contains transactional sales data including quantities, prices, and dates.
- **Dimension Tables:** Includes tables for `Customers`, `Products`, `Time`, and `Sales Representatives`, used to enrich sales fact data.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure you have a running instance of a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Load the SQL file into your database by using a SQL client tool or executing the script via the command line:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < sales-data-warehouse.sql
   ```
3. Review and adjust database credentials and settings as necessary.

## Dependencies
- This project requires a SQL database (compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Ensure that your SQL environment supports indexing and foreign key constraints.

## Usage
Once the database is set up, you can start querying the sales data warehouse to extract valuable insights such as:
- Total sales per region, product, or time period.
- Performance of sales representatives.
- Customer purchasing behavior.
